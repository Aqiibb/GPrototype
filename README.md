# ZART üßü‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

 Welcome to ZART! This is an immersive game crafted for those who love a good scare and enjoy solving puzzles. The game plunges players into a horror-themed maze where making the wrong turn could mean a heart-pounding jumpscare. Navigate cautiously and solve the puzzles to find your way out.
 This is a team project for a Game Development module created by a group of 4 students passionate about gaming and horror.

 Throughout this project, we encountered several challenges, especially with creating an unpredictable jumpscare system. We managed to overcome these hurdles by pooling our collective problem-solving skills.
